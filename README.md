API Summary: This API has a number of different protected routes making it easy for a logged in user to submit an order as well as give a user with proper admin credentials access to change, add, and delete orders or products. This API securely stores login credentials to MonogoDB and retrieves the user's email and password from the database. Within the project I have integrated the PayPal API as well. This allows the user to connect their PayPal account to the application to make purchases easier for the user. There are also endpoints integrated into the project specifically for filtering products in a number of different ways.
